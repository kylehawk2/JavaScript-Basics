          <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <body>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely poular for a variety of reasons. Its is a small and lightweight lightweight language allowing maximum flexiblity for developers to take it in a bunch of differnet directions. JavaScriptlives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

            <ul>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Variable Declaration:</span>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffe, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identifed with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.<span style="color: red">var x</span> 
              </li>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Variable Assignment:</span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffe poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable<span style="color: red">var x = 10</span>
              </li>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Data Types:</span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data types. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives; Boolean -<span style="color: red">true</span> or <span style="color: red">false</span>; null - <span style="color: red">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span style="color: red">42</span> or <span style="color: red">3.14159</span>; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array - <span style="color: red">[1, Coding', 2, 'Dojo']</span>and Object - <span style="color: red">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span> </li>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Conditionals:</span>When you write code, you want to preform different actions for different decisions - hitting differnet code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements:<span style="color: red">if</span>a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span style="color: red">else if</span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span style="color: red">else</span>we execute this block of code.</li>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Loops:</span>There are many differnet kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run  a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
              <li><span style="color: aqua">Function:</span>Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the intruction manuel and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly ther are a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
